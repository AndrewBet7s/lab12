# Working with GUIs

A GUI is a "Graphical User Interface". Using Tkinter we will make some very basic GUIs,
and begin to explore how interacting with GUIs can change the state of the program.

## 70pt

Use the code as a template to add a new button to the program called "Goodbye". Examine the code to see the different ways in
which properties of a button can be set.

## 85pt 

Add a cancel button with a red background. When the cancel button is pressed, change the color from red to blue and then back to red when pressed again.
Examine the existing code to implement the new button. You will need to define a new function for clicking the new button.

## 100pt

Add a button called "Right". Make it so that when you press the button, the oval moves to the right.
